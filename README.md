# AlexExperiments BMP to Array converter for CosmosOS!
A BMP to Array converter for C#, using Colors!
## How does it work?
When you compile and open the executable, it asks you for a Filename (the image you want to convert), it then saves as output.txt.
## More versions (Windows API colors for example) (probably not) yet to come.
## Important note
I sadly don't work with CosmosOS much, almost up no never, so this is *probably* going to stay **as is**. We'll see if I'll get back into CosmosOS sometime!
