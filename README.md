# AlexExperiments BMP to Array converter for CosmosOS!
A BMP to Array converter for C#, using Colors!
## How does it work?
When you compile and open the executable, it asks you for a Filename (the image you want to convert), it then saves as output.txt.
## More versions (Windows API colors for example) yet to come.
